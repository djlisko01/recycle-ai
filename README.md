# EYE-RecAIcle

CS5500: Foundation of Software Engineering

Team 3 - Daniel Lisko, Matthew Vargas, Michael Chang, Semaa Amin, and Yvette Green

## Project Description
Image Classification 
 - captures an image of a piece of garbage 
 - classifies the image as trash for landfill or a recyclable item
 - saves the data

## Hardware and Technologies Used
- Jetson Nano: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit
- Python
- Arduino board 
- ThingSpeak: https://thingspeak.com/


## How It Works

## Future Goals for the Project
- Expand on the model for more accurate predictions
   - Crowdsource to obtain images that expand our training data set (eg. captcha model)
- Connect to a database (scalability)
- Expand to include more categories 
   - E-waste and compost
- Possibly present the project at a SmartCities event
- Upgrade hardware 
   - 4GB or 8GB Jetson Nano 
   - Add better Arduino boards to include LED strip lights, LCD screens, and sound
